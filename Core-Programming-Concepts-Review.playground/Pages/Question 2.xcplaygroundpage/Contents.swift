 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating the ultimate competitor to GitHub.
 
 You want to keep track of the following metrics for each repository:
 
 - Number of commits: the total number of commits to the repository
 - Number of forks: the number of forks people have made from the repository
 - Year created: The year the repository was created
 - Month created: The month the repository was created represented by a number between 1 and 12
 - Day created: The day of the month the repository was created

 For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.

// Answer question 2 below
var commitsCreated = 1
var forksCreated = 1
print("Commits and forks created are mutable values meaning they can change. If we set them as let statments you wouldn't be able to change the amount of forks or commits done so you use variables instead.")
let yearRepCreated = 1
let monthRepCreated = 1
let dayRepCreated = 1
print("The day, month, and year your repository was created will never be changed unless you can somehow alter time. Since they will never change, using a let statment is the best way to do things as you prevent any unwanted/unnoticed changes.")
